# Dotfiles

These are my additions to [thoughtbot's
dotfiles](http://www.github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)

## Installation

Use these in combination with another set of dotfiles (such as thoughtbot's)
that load `.local` versions of themselves. Symlink both sets of dotfiles to your
root directory.

The easiest way to maintain this system is to use the
[`rcm`](http://www.github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) command-line utility
